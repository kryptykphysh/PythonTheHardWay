print "Hello World!"
print "Hello Again"
print "I like typing this."
print "This is fun."
print 'Yay! Printing.'
print "I'd much rather you 'not'."
print 'I "said" do not touch this.'

# 1. Make your script print another line.
print 'This is me printing another line. Whee.'

# 2. Make your script print only one of the lines.
# Just comment out the ones you don't want?

# 3. Put a '#' (octothorpe) character at the beginning of a line. 
# What did it do? Try to find out what this character does.

# Oops, I guess I jumped the gun on commenting out lines.
